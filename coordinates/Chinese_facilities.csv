Step 2: trace the roads to the complex entrances/exits. Either there is a checkpoint/break in the double fencing at the entrance/exit, or the double fencing cuts across the road forming a gate. There may be a guardhouse next to the gate
Step 3: trace the double fencing emanating from the entrances/exits to extend around the complex. The double fencing may appear as two or more lines, usually dark, that:
3a: are in most cases, though not always, straight and parallel, turning rigid corners
3b: enclose a band of a darker or lighter shade, which is the concrete ground in between the two fences
3c: cast segmented shadows as a fence would",
